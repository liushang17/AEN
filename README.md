# AEN
Alternative splicing (AS) assays at the single-cell level hold promise for uncovering critical splicing events associated with changes in cell states and providing insights into cellular splicing heterogeneity. However, the existing analysis tools in this field are still inadequate. 
To address this gap, we introduce AEN, a novel computational framework specifically designed to systematically elucidate the intricate relationship between splicing events and cell states. 
AEN excels at identifying key alternative splicing events that are intricately tied to state changes in the data, all while bypassing the need for cell identity information. Moreover, AEN has the capability to unveil the phenotypic implications of alternative splicing and shed light on potential regulatory mechanisms governing the interplay between splicing and gene expression. Additionally, AEN conducts cell clustering based on splicing events to effectively tackle the challenge of cellular splicing heterogeneity. 
Through the application of AEN to diverse single-cell datasets derived from developmental and disease studies, we substantiate its efficacy in uncovering splicing heterogeneity and elucidating the functional implications of alternative splicing.
